**1. How do I approach designing software?**

Working on my projects has helped me craft a more intentional and structured approach to software design. I’ve learned how important it is to balance functionality with maintainability by focusing on clean, modular code and clear documentation. My typical design process starts by carefully reading the project requirements—multiple times if needed—to make sure I fully understand the goal. From there, I plan out individual components or modules that can work independently and together. Moving forward, I can apply these same tactics, like writing reusable code and documenting sections clearly with header comments, to make future projects easier to update, debug, and scale. I also understand from working a professional job for 10 years that often times documentation is the highest priority for a project. The bulk of work isn't always boots-on-the-ground coding, but sometimes making it easier for engineers to come behind you to make sense of what is being done. 

**2. How do I approach developing programs?**

While working on my 3D scene and other recent projects, I developed a stronger habit of breaking problems into smaller parts and focusing on iterative progress. I made sure to build in short testing cycles where I could catch errors early instead of letting bugs pile up. Iteration factored heavily into my development; I would build a small part, test it immediately, and tweak it as needed before moving on. Over time, my approach evolved into being more proactive about debugging by adding simple debug outputs or checks directly in the code. This methodical, step-by-step mindset ultimately made it easier to deliver a clean, working final product without having to backtrack and fix major issues late in the process.

**3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Through working with computational graphics and visualizations, I’ve gained new technical skills that will strengthen both my educational and professional pathways. Understanding how to build and manipulate 3D scenes gave me hands-on experience with core programming concepts like object transformations, vector math, and modular design skills that translate directly into larger software development work. Educationally, these projects have expanded my problem-solving skills and made me more comfortable working on complex, multi-step problems, which will help as I move into higher-level computer science coursework. Professionally, these skills make me a stronger candidate for full-stack development or software engineering roles, where modular design, graphical thinking, and clean code practices are highly valued.
